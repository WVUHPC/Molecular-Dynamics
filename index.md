This series of lessons details the steps necessary to make use of some of the most popular Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation codes on WVU's most recent HPC cluster, Thorny Flat.

In the lessons, there is an introduction to the concept of MD simulation, followed by an introduction to each of the codes listed here: NAMD, Gromacs, and Amber. These lessons are by no means exhaustive; there is much to learn about how each of these codes work. However, the lessons provide the essentials to making use of the computing power of Thorny Flat, ultimately accelerating your simulations. Links to more information on the codes will be provided in their respective lessons.
