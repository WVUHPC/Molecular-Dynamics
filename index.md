This series of lessons details the steps necessary to make use of some of the most popular Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation codes on WVU's most recent HPC cluster, Thorny Flat.

In the lessons, there is an introduction to the concept of MD simulation, followed by an introduction to each of the codes listed here: NAMD, Gromacs, and Amber. These lessons are by no means exhaustive; there is much to learn about how each of these codes work. However, the lessons provide the essentials to making use of the computing power of Thorny Flat, ultimately accelerating your simulations. Links to more information on the codes will be provided in their respective lessons.

> ## Prerequisites
>
> The prerequisites for this course are to have downloaded VMD (Visual Molecular Dynamics) at the link here: https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Development/Download/download.cgi?PackageName=VMD
> Additionally, any software that you are interested in running on the cluster would be best to install locally on your computer for running pieces of the tutorial that are shorter but this is not absolutely necessary as the steps can be completed on the cluster.
> NAMD: https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Development/Download/download.cgi?PackageName=NAMD
